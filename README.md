# TMA4500-Project-Hovland-Symplectic-Stiefel

This repo contains code for the project report "Riemannian Optimization using second
order Information on the Symplectic
Stiefel manifold". It also contains the LaTex code for the report, as well as the actual report in .pdf format. 

Note that the scripts "gr_desc_SpGr_retract_comparison.jl", "grad_desc_nearest_sp_matrix.jl", and "pluto_warmup.jl" are not part of the report, but some users might find them insightful.
