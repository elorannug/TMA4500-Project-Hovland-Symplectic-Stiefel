\section{Algorithms}
In this section, we introduce the algorithms of interest in this Specialization project. They are used by Jensen and Zimmermann for optimization on $\mathrm{SpSt}(2n, 2k)$. The goal is to study the feasibility of these algorithms by attempting to reproduce some of the findings of Jensen and Zimmermann.
