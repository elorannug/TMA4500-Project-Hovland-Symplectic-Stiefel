\section{Algorithms}
In this section, we introduce the algorithms of interest in this Specialization project. They are used by Jensen and Zimmermann for optimization on $\mathrm{SpSt}(2n, 2k)$. One of our goals is to study the feasibility of these algorithms by attempting to reproduce some of the findings of Bendokat and Zimmermann \cite{BendokatZimmermann2021}, and Jensen and Zimmermann \cite{JensenZimmermann2024}.
