\begin{definition}[Smooth manifold]
    Given a topological space $\mathcal{M}$, it is a topological manifold of dimension $n$ if
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\mathcal{M}$ is a Hausdorff space: for every pair of $p,q\in \mathcal{M}$, we can always find to disjoint subsets of $\mathcal{M}$, $U$ and $V$, such that $p\in U$ and $q\in V$.
        \item $\mathcal{M}$ is second-countable: the topology of $\mathcal{M}$ has a countable basis.
        \item $\mathcal{M}$ is locally Euclidean of dimension n: for each $p$ we have an open subset $U \subseteq \mathcal{M}$ containing $p$, and an open subset $\hat{U}\in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ such that there exists a homeomorphism $\phi:U \xrightarrow{}\hat{U}$.
    \end{enumerate}
    If we in addition have a notion of smoothness, meaning that the notion of differentiability is well-defined, we call $\mathcal{M}$ a smooth manifold.
\end{definition}

% TODO: Is this a paper? ⚠️
For the rest of this paper we denote $\mathcal{M}$ as being a Riemannian manifold.
