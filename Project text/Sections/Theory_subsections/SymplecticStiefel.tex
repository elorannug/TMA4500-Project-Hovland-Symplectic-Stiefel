\subsection{The Symplectic Stiefel manifold}
% Defining the basic structures on the symplectic Stiefel manifold
Now that we have defined thy symplectic group, we introduce the manifold of interest, the real symplectic Stiefel manifold. It is defined as
\begin{equation*}
    \mathrm{SpSt}(2n, 2k)\coloneqq \{p\in \mathbb{R}^{2n\times2k}:p ^{\mathrm{T}}J_{2n}p=J_{2k}\}.
\end{equation*}
Following \cite[Prop.~3.1]{BendokatZimmermann2021}, it is explicitly connected to the symplectic group in the sense that $\mathrm{SpSt}(2n, 2k)$ is diffeomorphic to the following quotient manifold of $\mathrm{sp}(2n)$:
\begin{equation*}
    \mathrm{SpSt}(2n, 2k)\cong \mathrm{Sp}(2n)/\mathrm{Sp}(2(n-k)),
\end{equation*}
where the notion of quotient manifold is as in \Cref{def:quotient_manifold}. It has dimension $\mathrm{dim}(\mathrm{SpSt}(2n, 2k))=(2n-2k+1)k$. 

The \todo{This is probably unnecessary}following piece of insight can give some further intuition on what the Symplectic Stiefel manifold is. We note that the Stiefel manifold is a quotient space, as defined in \Cref{def:quotient_manifold}, of the orthogonal group as defined in \Cref{def:orthogonal_group} such that $\mathrm{St}(2n, 2k)=\mathrm{O}(n)/\mathrm{O}(n-k)$.
