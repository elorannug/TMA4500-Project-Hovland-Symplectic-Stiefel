\subsection{The Symplectic Stiefel manifold}
% Defining the basic structures on the symplectic Stiefel manifold
Having defined the real symplectic group, we introduce the manifold of interest, the real symplectic Stiefel manifold. It is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:spst_def}
    \mathrm{SpSt}(2n, 2k)\coloneqq \{p\in \mathbb{R}^{2n\times2k} \;|\; p^{+}p=I_{2k}\},
\end{equation}
where $p^{+}$ is defined as in \eqref{eq:symplectic_inverse}. Following \cite[Prop.~3.1]{BendokatZimmermann2021}, it is explicitly connected to the symplectic group in the sense that $\mathrm{SpSt}(2n, 2k)$ is diffeomorphic to the following quotient manifold of $\mathrm{Sp}(2n)$:
\begin{equation*}
    \mathrm{SpSt}(2n, 2k)\cong \mathrm{Sp}(2n)/\mathrm{Sp}(2(n-k)),
\end{equation*}
where the notion of a quotient manifold is defined as in Definition~\ref{def:quotient_manifold}. It has dimension \\$\mathrm{dim}(\mathrm{SpSt}(2n, 2k))=(2n-2k+1)k$. The following piece of insight regarding the Stiefel manifold, defined in Definition~\ref{def:stiefel_manifold}, can give some further intuition on what the symplectic Stiefel manifold is. We note that the Stiefel manifold is a quotient space, as defined in Definition~\ref{def:quotient_manifold}, of the orthogonal group, as defined in Definition~\ref{def:orthogonal_group}, such that $\mathrm{St}(2n, 2k)=\mathrm{O}(n)/\mathrm{O}(n-k)$. 

In a similar manner as for the symplectic group, the expression for the tangent space follows straightforwardly from the definition of $\mathrm{SpSt}(2n, 2k)$. Assume we have a curve, $c(t)\in \mathrm{SpSt}(2n,2k)$, such that $c(0)=p$ and $\dot{c}(0)\coloneqq\tfrac{d}{dt}c(t)|_{t=0}=X$. Since $c(t)$ is a curve in $\mathrm{SpSt}(2n,2k)$, by \eqref{eq:spst_def} it must satisfy the following condition:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:spst_tangent_space_derivation}
    c(t) ^{\mathrm{T}}J_{2n}c(t)=J_{2k}.
\end{equation}
Taking the derivative of \eqref{eq:spst_tangent_space_derivation} with respect to $t$ at $t=0$ we get
\begin{equation*}
    \dot{c}^{\mathrm{T}}(t)J_{2n}c(t)+c^{\mathrm{T}}(t)J_{2n}\dot{c}\big|_{t=0}=X ^{\mathrm{T}}J_{2n}p+p ^{\mathrm{T}}J_{2n}X=0_{2k}.
\end{equation*}
After moving the first term over to the left hand side, and multiplying with $J_{2n}$ from the left, the expression simplifies to
\begin{equation*}
    p^{+}X=-X^{+}p.
\end{equation*}
We recognize this condition as $p^{+}X\in \mathfrak{sp}(2k)$ as defined in \eqref{eq:sp_Lie_algebra}. This means that for a point $p$, 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:spst_tangent_space}
    T_{p}\mathrm{SpSt}(2n,2k)=\left\{X\in \mathbb{R}^{2n\times2k}\;\middle|\;p^{+}X\in\mathfrak{sp}(2k)\right\}.
\end{equation}
Now, after defining the symplectic Stiefel manifold, and its tangent space, we will proceed to define the righ-invariant metric on $\mathrm{SpSt}(2n, 2k)$ in preparation for defining an explicit expression of the geodesics on the manifold.
