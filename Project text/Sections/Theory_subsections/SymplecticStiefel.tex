\subsection{The Symplectic Stiefel manifold}
% Defining the basic structures on the symplectic Stiefel manifold

\todo[inline]{Prop 3.1 BZ: SpSt as a quotient space of Sp(2n). Stab$_E$ is defined in the proof of the proposition.}

The \todo{This is probably unnecessary}following piece of insight can give some further intuition on what the Symplectic Stiefel manifold is. We note that the Stiefel manifold is a quotient space, as defined in \Cref{def:quotient_space}, of the orthogonal group as defined in \Cref{def:orthogonal_group} such that $\mathrm{St}(2n, 2k)=\mathrm{O}(n)/\mathrm{O}(n-k)$.
