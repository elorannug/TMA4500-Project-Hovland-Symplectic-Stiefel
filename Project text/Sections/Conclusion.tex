\section{Conclusion}

Jensen and Zimmermann chose to leave out the Riemannian BFGS method from their experiments \cite[p.~11]{JensenZimmermann2024}. They did this because they found it to not be competitive to the other methods they used. Despite this it could be interesting to try to validate these findings using \text{Manopt.jl} and/or on problems expected to be better suited to the Riemannian BFGS method.
