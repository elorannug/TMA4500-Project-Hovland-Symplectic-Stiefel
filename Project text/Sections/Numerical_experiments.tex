\section{Numerical Experiments}\label{sec:Numerical_experiments}
In this section we present the numerical experiments, and results, conducted in this report. We have conducted the following three experiments on $\mathrm{SpSt}(2n, 2k)$: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item retraction comparison between the Cayley retraction, Riemannian geodesics, and pseudo-Riemannian geodesics through the nearest symplectic matrix problem using GD, 
    \item comparing the performance of GD, TR-1, and TR-2 through the nearest symplectic matrix problem, and 
    \item comparing the GD, TR-1, and TR-2 through the problem of performing a proper symplectic decomposition.
\end{enumerate}
The problem of nearest symplectic matrix is used in both Bendokat and Zimmermann \cite[p.~25]{BendokatZimmermann2021} as well as Jensen and Zimmermann \cite[p.~15]{JensenZimmermann2024}, and the problem of proper symplectic decomposition is used in Jensen and Zimmermann \cite[p.~17]{JensenZimmermann2024}. The first experiment is conducted in a similar manner to Bendokat and Zimmermann \cite[p.~25]{BendokatZimmermann2021}, where we leverage the problem of nearest symplectic matrix to compare the performance of the Cayley retraction, the Riemannian geodesic, and the pseudo-Riemannian geodesic through the use of GD. The second and third experiments are conducted similarly to the analogous experiments in Jensen and Zimmermann \cite[p.~15~\&~17]{JensenZimmermann2024} where the purpose of these two experiments is to compare the performance of the GD, TR-1, and TR-2 algorithms. The reason for conducting both of these experiments is to make the conclusions we derive more robust than if only one experiment was conducted. 

The experiments are performed using Julia version 1.10.2 on the Laptop ACER Swift SF314-43 processor AMD Ryzen 7 5700U with Radeon Graphics 1.80GHz and 16GB of RAM. To ensure reproducibility, all of the random processes are seeded using the seed $42$. For readability, the code is written in the Pluto.jl notebook format, a format that allows for interactive code execution and visualization in a similar manner to the Python equivalent "Jupyter notebook".
